# MI-Hoops-Scoring
MI HOOPS SCORING


Essentially, this is a way to track MI basketball scores. Simply follow the prompts after compiling and running to start the adventure of keeping track of scores! Both teams can be inputted with any amount of players, inserted by their first and last initial. The away team doesn't necessarily have to have players that are kept track of if you don't know their names--there just needs to be one "dummy" player to allow for the away team's score to update. It just so happens that I included the AWESOME functionality of exporting data when the program ends to a CSV file for each team! WOAH! Aren't I nice! Drag this file into a google sheet and then voila- you have your data inputted to track anything you want. 

The only downside is that unfortunately I have not added the functionality of exporting the FG % for 2s and 3s even though there is a command to track them while the program is running. This is because I like to make things as intentionally inconvient as possible to anyone who wants to use my stuff. To get around this, simply do the ATTEMPT command twice for each team (one for twos, one for threes) before you close the program at the end of the game to identify what those percentages are. 

The executable file is included, so for easy access, you can just run this file instead of compiling again. THIS IS FOR MAC OS THOUGH. For other OS, do whatever it takes to compile on your system. 

Enjoy!
